# Horiseon Refactor Challenge

## Description 

It's important for technology to be accessible to everybody. I took on this project as I believe in that wholeheartedly. This project has solved an issue where it wasn't able to be adequately read by screen readers and the like. I learnt an important lesson relating to sticking within the scope of the project. I made the decision to try to fix an issue with the website by creating a minimum width. While gaining feedback on my work, it was pointed out to me that I had just made it look better on a desktop while neglecting to realise that if it was viewd on a smaller screen it wouldn't be easy to view anymore.
